## Open Source

### [`ts-prune`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-prune)

CLI tool with ~250k+ downloads/month on npm to find unused code in typescript projects. [Added a small feature](https://github.com/nadeesha/ts-prune/pull/140) to allow specfifying a pattern to exclude files from counting toward code use, for instance `.test.ts` - so that functions that were tested but not used anywhere else in the codebase could still be identified and removed.

## Projects

### [`crypto-cli`](https://github.com/sauntimo/crypto-cli)
A CLI tool written in typescript to get crypto asset prices.
